_solve1.py is a dead script (decided on different route)_

_solve2.py is a dead script (decided on different route)_

Part #1 is solved by `python solve11.py < big.in`

Part #2 is a doozy....

solve22.py will generate an equation like `2*(3+H) = 6` and then I used Wolfram Alpha to solve the generated Equation for H.

`python solve22.py < big.in > equation.in`

_solver.py is a dead script wherein I tried to use sympy's `solve()` method but it sucks._
